# neuralplex

3 layer configurable neural network with back and resilient propagation learning. Implemented for rapid convergence and ease of use.

# Usage Example

Refer to [test_network.cc](https://github.com/f3z0/neuralplex/blob/master/src/test_network.cc) for training, convergence testing, and model usage example.

My answer on StackExchange [XOR backpropagation convergence](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/129472/xor-backpropagation-convergence/131402#131402)

This C++ implementation based on the following whitepaper by Martin Riedmiller & Heinrich Braun *A Direct Adaptive Method for Faster Backpropagation Learning: The RPROP Algorithm* which can be found [here](https://github.com/f3z0/neuralplex/blob/master/RPROPpaper.pdf)
